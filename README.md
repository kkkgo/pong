# Pong

A Linux program that replies to `ping` but modifies the payload of the ICMP
packet to get lower ping times in some `ping` implementations.

Install it with `cargo install --git https://github.com/m-ou-se/pong`.

You either need to run it as root, or you need to disable your kernel's ping
reply with 
```sh
sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all=1 
sysctl net.ipv6.icmp.echo_ignore_all=1
```
and give this program `cap_net_raw` capabilities with `setcap cap_net_raw=ep ~/.cargo/bin/pong`.
